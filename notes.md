## How to delete articles? 

Need to be able to regenerate xml file from saved articles, so deleted articles will reflect in the feed.

User data stored in form of saved articles (url strings) and xml feed file. On add/remove article, can regenerate xml file. Generating xml file requires parsing each url with Readability. xml files could get really long since articles' full text will be present.
